# Big Data and AI Patents Analysis
In nowadays' fast-paced world patents are released within tiny timeframes. New technologies come out on a regular basis. Though for some the leaders in these spheres are obvious, others might come up with a couple of questions: Who dominates today's AI science? Who was a former leader? Where do breakthroughs come from? - Our team decided to address this matter and, therefore, we are building a bridge between enthusiasts who are keen in understanding up-to-date science frontier problems and the science itself. 

## Project goal
Retrieve data about patents in Big Data and AI from resources such as Wikidata, EPO (European Patent Ontology). Create interactrive visualizations using this data. Understand modern trends in AI and Big Data. Learn the leaders in the field. Observe latest scientific problems concerning new technologies and their bottlenecks.
