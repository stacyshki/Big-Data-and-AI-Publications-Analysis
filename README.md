Big Data and AI Publications Analysis

In nowadays' fast-paced world scientific publications are released within extremely short timeframes. New technologies emerge on a regular basis, shaping the future of data-driven industries. While for some the leaders in these fields are obvious, others may raise a number of questions: Who dominates today’s AI research? Who were the former leaders? Where do the main scientific breakthroughs originate from?
Our team decided to address these questions by building a bridge between enthusiasts who are eager to understand the current scientific frontier and the research community itself.

Project goal

Retrieve data about scientific publications in the fields of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence from open resources such as Wikidata and other linked open data (LoD) sources. Create interactive visualizations based on this data to analyze modern trends in AI and Big Data research. Identify key contributors and leading institutions in the field. Observe current scientific challenges, emerging topics, and potential bottlenecks in modern technologies.
